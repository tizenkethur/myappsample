    This is my app 

    Add our name to .git file 
    git config --global user.name 'Vivien Talos'
    git config --global user.email 'vivientalos29@gmail.com'

    git rm --cached <file> = removing files from the stage area 
    git *.html = add any html file to the staging area
    git add . = add all the files to the staging area  --> if u write sth in it, if u modify sth, u have to use this command again

    git commit = it will open a new window for enter the commit message
--> at first you have to press Insert to become able to write into it, u have to delete # from Initial commit line, press esc and :wq enter 
--> after that we receive information about which files have been commited 
--> if you modify sth after u can use git add . and git commit -m 'write here what is changed'

    git ignore = we can include files or folders what we don't want to include in our repo at all
